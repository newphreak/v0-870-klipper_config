# This file contains common pin mappings for the BIGTREETECH SKR
# MINI 2.0. To use this config, the firmware should be compiled for 
# the STM32F103 with a "28KiB bootloader". Also select "enable extra 
# low-level configuration options" and configure "GPIO pins to set 
# at micro-controller startup" to "!PA14".

# The "make flash" command does not work on the SKR mini. Instead,
# after running "make", copy the generated "out/klipper.bin" file to a
# file named "firmware.bin" on an SD card and then restart the SKR
# mini with that SD card.

# See the example.cfg file for a description of available parameters.
